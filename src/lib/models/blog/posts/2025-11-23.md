# Neutral Jing

Yesterday, Dia told me that she doesn’t want to power through and achieve something just because she can. Instead, she prefers to read and wait for the right influences.

This is a mindset I thought was worth saving.

I’ve had some time to recuperate. I’ve found a decent job that pays well but doesn’t try to devour me. I wouldn’t call it a calling, but for now, it’s nice.
