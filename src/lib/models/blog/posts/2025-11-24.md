# Voyager

Experiencing the evolution of the internet as a child means that you are kind of okay with what is happening, but at the same time you also get what older people are complaining about.

I have thought that privacy went extinct. What you share on the web stays forever, Google finds you, everything is being heard. 

When I am afraid of something, I try to image how I would feel in the opposite scenario. Would I choose not having ticket on the tram, or desperately wanting to find inspector?

Now? Posting this here for someone to read feels as if I were being teleported to a random point in the galaxy, hoping to find life.

Makes me think about how the shape of the Internet have changed. From lattice to scale-free. From the woods to a metropolis.

Can we enjoy the trees again? Should we walk in the park? How?

Just make this falsifiable: prove me wrong. Write me an email, please.
